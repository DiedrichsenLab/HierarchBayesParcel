    "This jupyter notebook is to test different emission models, including a Gaussian mixture, a directional model (VMF), and our novely desinged Gaussian Mixture with exponential signal strength. The main porpuse of this short example is trying to show the three models are correctly fitted via an EM procedure."

Because the data for fitting VMF must be normalized, such that $\\color{red}{(||\\mathbf{y}||_2=1)}$, the $N$-dimensional simulation data is then defined on the %N-1% hypershpere's surface with each dimension in the range of $\\color{red}{-1}$ to $\\color{red}{+1}$.\n",
